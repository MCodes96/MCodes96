# Hello world
## Full-Stack Developer currently @ Yunivers UG

My Name is Mikayil.

For the sake of simplicity feel free to call me Miki, pronounced like Mickey.
I want to build amazing software which makes people happy and is useful to them.
That is my way to give back.

I'll be uploading all my own projects onto my GitHub profile.
Some of them might be tutorials I tried.
