# Hello world
## Learning to code - My Journey

Date: 27. October 2021

My Name is Mikayil.

For the sake of simplicity feel free to call me Miki, pronounced like Mickey Mouse.

By the time I'm writing this I'm 3 weeks into coding.
I'm trying to become a self-taught Full-Stack developer because I want to build amazing software which makes people happy and is useful to them.
That is my way to give back.
