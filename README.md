# Hello world
## Full-Stack Developer

My Name is Mikayil.

For the sake of simplicity feel free to call me Miki, pronounced like Mickey.
I want to build amazing software which makes people happy and is useful to them.
That is my way to give back.

I rarely upload any projects to my GitHub and most of the stuff on here are tutorials I tried a few years ago.
Maybe I'll create some nice portfolio projects soon. ;)
